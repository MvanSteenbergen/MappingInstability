# Introduction
Ecological momentary assessment has made it possible to construct time series from self-report scales. This allows one to capture the dynamics of mood over time. While many . 

Recurrence quantification analysis is one of the methods to analyse time series data. This method aims to capture repeating patterns in time series by quantifying which observations $x_{t+y}$ are equivelent to $x_{t}$, where t refers to the time of an observation, x to an observation, and y is the distance to t where that point recurs.

Traditionally, this method is used in the physical sciences, where measurements can both be retrieved much more frequently and be measured at a higher resolution, up to a certain decimal point (think of temperature, ). Measures in ecological momentary assessment often rely on likert scales, and have much lower precision. 


We will simulate a 

For practical reasons, we assume that these ordinal measurements reflect an underlying continuous measure, even though that is somewhat contentious, and .
