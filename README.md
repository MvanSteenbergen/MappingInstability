## Running the code

### Installing Pluto

The code is in the folder "Code". If you haven't installed the julia language, install it first at [the Julia website](https://julialang.org/). Make sure the file hierarchy is maintained, so clone the entire repository!

These contain the version information for the packages and they should be installed automatically. Open a Julia-terminal in the containing folder.

    using Pkg
    Pkg.add("Pluto")
    using Pluto
    Pluto.run()
