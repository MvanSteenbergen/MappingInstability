## Introduction

-    In social sciences research, we usually treat the variation that is natural in data as something to control for, apart from the variation caused by our input variables.
-    Think of a typical ANOVA:
     1.   We derive averages for our dependent variable. By estimating the expected value we aim to control for all variation in our signal. 
     2.   We divide our sample into groups, and aim to average out all variation caused by changes beyond our variables of interest.

## Introduction
-    This is a very effective research strategy. The experiment is the ultimate example! 
     1.   It allows us to make inferences about the average strength of the effect of a manipulation.
     2.   It allows us to disentangle the effect on a dependent variable by a manipulation of independent variables between pre-defined groups.
-    In short, a well-administered experimental or correlational study, is nothing to jeer at.

## Dynamics
-    But there are a lot of aspects that are difficult to capture by relying on aggregates. To name just one 
-    For example, how does mood fluctuate over the day?
-    Or what can we say the way your pupil moves to scan your environment?
-    Both of these questions go into *dynamics*: the forces and motions that characterize a system. 

## Dynamics
-    The "forces" that lead to a change in mood, or that decide how you scan the room with your eyes, are  difficult to model:
     1.   The forces are numerous.
     2.   Interactions between those forces are numerous.
     3.   Interactions between those forces are non-linear.
     4.   It is impossible to infer the behaviour of the larger system by exclusively studying its components.
-    Systems like these are found in every research field, and are studied by 

## Are time series random or chaotic?

-   *Chaotic* behaviour is complex behaviour that can be fully deterministic, but is difficult to predict.
-   *Random* is the classical understanding of random, like flipping a coin.
