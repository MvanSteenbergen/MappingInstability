## What is Recurrence Quantification Analysis?

* **Wikipedia:** RQA quantifies the number and duration of recurrences of a dynamic system presented by its phase space trajectory.
* Yeah...

## Okay, that's a mouthful

* Let's break that down into bits:
* RQA *quantifies* the number and duration of *recurrences* of a *dynamic system* presented by its *phase space* trajectory.

## Dynamical system

## Phase space

## Recurrence

* A time point recurs when it hits the same value as it did before. Say, you feel a good three out of five 

## Quantifies
* The *number*:
* The *duration*:



## Are time series random or chaotic?

* *Chaotic* behaviour is complex behaviour that can be fully deterministic, but difficult to predict.
* *Random* is the classical understanding of random, like flipping a coin.
